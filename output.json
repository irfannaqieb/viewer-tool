1. "upload" all images
2. iterate over all image one by one
3. for each image
	- identify the heading. (user need to pan to the assumed north and click a button to set this as north)
	- identify the link nodes. (maybe ada search bar to search all file names, simply select connected images.)
	- extract gps coordinates.
	
4. extract everything as json
